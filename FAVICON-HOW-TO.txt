How to add a favicon!

Firstly a favicon is that small image you see on the tab or address bar.

Firstly make you favicon, I recommend putting your logo through this: http://www.favicon.co.uk/
Choose your image/logo and select 64x64 and generate it. You will then be able to download the favicon.

Make sure the name of it is 'favicon.ico'

Next add the following code to every page on your website, you need to put it somewhere within the head tags <head></head>, if you don't it won't work!

Heres the code:

<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"/>
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"/>
